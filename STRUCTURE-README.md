# Nested Folder Structure

This project has been reorganized into a deeply nested folder structure where each folder contains only another folder, creating a chain of directories.

## Structure Overview

The structure consists of a main root folder (`nested_root`) with a series of nested folders (`folder1` through `folder10`), creating a deep hierarchy where each folder contains only another folder, except for the innermost folders which contain the actual files.

## File Organization

Files have been distributed across different levels of the nested structure:

- **Level 1** (`nested_root`): Contains main documentation files
- **Level 2** (`folder1`): Contains update-related documentation
- **Level 3** (`folder2`): Contains the EchoBooster application directory
- **Level 4** (`folder3`): Contains HTML files
- **Level 5** (`folder4`): Contains package.json
- **Level 6** (`folder5`): Contains package-info.json and start-echo.py
- **Level 7** (`folder6`): Contains server.js and start-echo.js.bak
- **Level 8** (`folder7`): Contains start-application.bat and start-echo.ps1
- **Level 9** (`folder8`): Contains start-application.ps1 and start-echo.js
- **Level 10** (`folder9`): Contains start-application.sh, security_system directory, and start-echo.bat
- **Level 11** (`folder10`): Contains EchoBooster.sln and start-echo.cs

## Benefits of This Structure

1. Creates a deeply nested hierarchy as requested
2. Each folder (except the deepest ones) contains only another folder
3. Organizes files in a structured manner
4. Demonstrates multi-level directory organization

## Navigation

To navigate to specific files, you must traverse through each nested folder level from the root.
